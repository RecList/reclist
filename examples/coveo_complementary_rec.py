"""
    This is a sample script showing how to get started with reclist. In particular,
    we are targeting a "complementary items" use cases, such as for example a cart recommender:
    if a shopper added item X to the cart, what is she likely to add next?

    We train a simple, yet effective prod2vec baseline model (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14906),
    re-using for convenience a "training embedding" function already implemented by recsys. The script
    show how easy it is to run behavioral tests on a target dataset, in this case a wrapper around a large
    e-commerce dataset (the Coveo Data Challenge dataset: https://github.com/coveooss/SIGIR-ecom-data-challenge).

    If you want to run your own model on the same dataset and the same behavioral test suite, just implement
    your model prediction using the RecModel, and pass it to the CartList.
