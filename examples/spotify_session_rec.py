"""
    This is a sample script showing how to get started with reclist. In particular,
    we are targeting the use case of session-based recommendations.

    We train a simple, yet effective prod2vec baseline model (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14906),
    re-using for convenience a "training embedding" function already implemented by recsys. The script
    shows how easy it is to run behavioral tests on a target dataset, in this case a wrapper around a large
    music dataset (the Spotify Million Playlist dataset:
    https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge).

    If you want to run your own model on the same dataset and the same behavioral test suite, just implement
    your model prediction using the RecModel, and pass it to the RecList.
